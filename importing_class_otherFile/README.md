NOTES
1. First you have to include the package.like the folder in which the java file is there ,you have to include it.
example - suppose folder name is practice_class_two
then the line will be like -> package practice_class_two

2. For importing the other java file then statement is ->
import folder_name.folder_name... .java_fileName
you can also include the class name if you want.
Slash(/) is dot(.) here.(for directry indicator)

3. you can only access the main class from the other file,the class which will be having the main method you can only call that.So if you want then you can make the classes declare and define the method in that class but ,make objects in the main class then will be returned to the called java file.
